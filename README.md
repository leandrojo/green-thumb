# Challenge Red Ventures
## Getting Started
The scripts are the default, for download dependencies:

```sh 
yarn 
```

To run the development version:
```sh 
yarn start 
```
Start a service on: `http://localhost:3000`,

To build the files for production:
```sh 
yarn build 
```

You can test the production version with the static server, [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve):
```sh 
serve build
```
